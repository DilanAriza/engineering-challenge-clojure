# Clojure Engineering Challenge Solutions

This repository contains the solutions to the engineering challenge problems. Each problem has its own solution in a corresponding `.clj` file located in the `src` folder.

## Problem 1: Thread-last Operator ->>

**File:** [src/first_problem.clj](./src/first_problem.clj)

This file contains the solution to the first problem, which involves using the thread-last ->> operator to find invoice items that meet certain conditions.

To test the solution, you can load the invoice and run the corresponding function.

## Problem 2: Core Generating Functions

**File:** [src/second_problem.clj](./src/second_problem.clj)

This file presents the solution to the second problem, which involves generating an invoice that meets a given specification from a JSON file.

You can test the solution by providing a JSON file name as an argument and checking if the generated invoice meets the specification.

## Problem 3: Test Driven Development

**File:** [src/third_problem.clj](./src/third_problem.clj)

This file contains the solution to the third problem, which focuses on test-driven development. A `subtotal` function is provided along with several tests that demonstrate its correctness.

Run the tests to ensure that the `subtotal` function works correctly and covers all edge cases.
